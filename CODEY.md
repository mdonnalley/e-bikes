## Making changes to the codebase

- If the user asks to make changes to the codebase and create a PR, you MUST commit the changes to a feature branch first, then push the branch to the remote repository. Once you've done those, you may create a PR.
- When creating a PR, you must include an excellent description of the changes you made.
